# Learned replica exchange (LREX)

Code to reproduce the paper [Skipping the replica exchange ladder with normalizing flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14104).

Based on [bgflow](https://github.com/noegroup/bgflow) (`michele` branch, soon to be merged into main).
Uses `OpenMM` for MD simulations and the `openmm-plumed` plugin to run [OPES](https://www.plumed.org/doc-master/user-doc/html/_o_p_e_s.html).

work in progress...

TODO: 
- add env for easy setup
- add output data
